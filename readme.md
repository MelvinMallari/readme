hi, i'm melvin 👋🏽

## practical communication info

- feel free to message me on slack, anytime
- if it's outside of work hours (9am - 6pm PST), please let me know if it's urgent— otherwise i'll treat it asynchronously
- text/call, if needed: (650) 438-5544

## what's your style?

- i like lists, usually prioritized
- i favor simplicity. this sometimes means less, but not always
- i'm usually lighthearted
- my rote memory isn't the best. i need a good conceptual understanding to remember things. this leads me asking how and why often
- i really like learning! especially under the lens of 'how can i apply this to do more useful things'
- i learn best by approaching a subject from multiple angles & mediums (books, videos, blog posts, etc) then applying

## what i don't have patience for

- nihilism aka not caring
- pessimism
- lack of integrity

## things i'm working on

- finding the right balance between 'figuring it out on my own' & 'asking for help'
- focusing more on what matters
- using less exclamation points on slack to avoid sounding insane

## how to best communicate with me

- reach out and say hi! i'm mostly extroverted and i will appreciate it 🙂
- tell me the truth! i always assume that i'm to some degree wrong and want to be less wrong
- prefer written communication when sufficient. happy to hop on a call if that's better
- feel free to add _any_ additional context you feel necessary (clarity > conciseness)
